#### Introduction  :

Our team project is to facilitate career and technical guidance to students and
job seekers by experts in the field.
Mentees are students, job seekers or employees who are highly motivated,
want to improve their skills and working career growth.
Mentors, on other hand, are those who are willing to share their experience
and knowledge to guide people to achieve their goals.
Our website is going to be a bridge between mentee and mentors in
Luxembourg, a country which has a more diverse population.
